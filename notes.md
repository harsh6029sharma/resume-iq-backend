  "feedback": {
    "1. Overall Match Assessment": {
      "Is the ATS match percentage realistic?": "Yes, the match percentage of 46.67% is realistic given the overlap between the resume and job description skills.",
      "Would a real ATS or recruiter shortlist this resume?": "Possibly, but it's on the lower side. A more competitive match would be around 60% or higher for most competitive roles."
    },
    "2. Strengths": {
      "Skills that clearly match the job description": [
        "javascript",
        "docker",
        "aws",
        "mongodb",
        "python",
        "git",
        "react"
      ],
      "Strong signals from the resume": "The resume includes relevant full-stack development skills and cloud experience with AWS. It also shows familiarity with modern JavaScript frameworks like React and backend technologies like Node.js."
    },
    "3. Missing or Weak Skills": {
      "Skills required in the JD but missing or weak in the resume": [
        "azure",
        "css",
        "html",
        "restful",
        "angular",
        "node.js",
        "java",
        "sql"
      ],
      "Mention if any critical or deal-breaker skills are absent": "Azure and Java are notable deal-breaker skills if the job is heavily focused on those. Angular and RESTful API design are also important for a full-stack developer role."
    },
    "4. Resume Improvement Suggestions": {
      "How to improve or rephrase skills for better ATS matching": "Include 'Node.js' instead of 'node' to match the exact keyword in the job description. Add 'Angular' and 'RESTful' to the skills list.",
      "Suggestions for adding projects, tools, or keywords": "Add a brief project example showcasing Angular or RESTful API development. Include Azure experience if available, or mention cloud migration or integration projects.",
      "Tips to make the resume more role-specific": "Tailor the resume to emphasize full-stack development with Angular and Java if applicable. Add HTML/CSS skills to show front-end proficiency."
    },
    "5. ATS Optimization Tips": {
      "Keyword usage and placement suggestions": "Use exact keywords like 'Node.js', 'Angular', 'RESTful', and 'Azure' in both the skills section and the body of the resume.",
      "Skill phrasing improvements": "Use 'Node.js' instead of 'node' and 'Java' instead of 'java' for better keyword matching.",
      "Formatting or section-level advice": "Ensure the skills section is clearly labeled and easy to parse by ATS. Use bullet points for clarity and keyword density."
    },
    "6. Final Verdict": {
      "Shortlisting probability": "Medium",
      "One-line recruiter verdict": "The resume shows relevant skills but is missing key requirements like Angular, Java, and Azure, which may reduce its chances of being shortlisted."
    }
  }
